## ATM Simulator

This program simulates an Automated Teller Machine (ATM) where users can deposit, withdraw, and check their account balance. The goal is to provide a simple and interactive interface for managing a customer's bank account.

## Interest Update

The Interest Update program is designed to apply interest to multiple customers' accounts based on their current balance. It reads account balances from a pipe-delimited file (`account_balances.txt`), calculates the interest earned or charged for each account, updates the balances, and saves the updated data to a CSV file (`updated_balances_FL.csv`). The program also prints the updated account balances to the console.
